This is a space shooter game independently developed using Unity. Players can choose between single-player or co-op (two-player) modes. The goal is to dodge enemy ships and their bullets while shooting back to score points. Scores and the high score are displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. Each game starts with three lives, shown in the top-right corner. Players can collect falling items like shields, advanced bullets, and speed boosts with their ship. Both modes support pausing the game with the "P" key. The game ends when the player dies, and they can press "R" to restart or return to the main menu.  

Controls:  
- Single-player mode: Use ASWD or arrow keys to move the ship and the spacebar to shoot.  
- Two-player mode: Player 1 uses ASWD to move and F to shoot; Player 2 uses JKIL to move and J to shoot.
